  long_name: Convert signed 32-bit integer to single-precision float
  description: |
    Converts a 32-bit signed integer in integer register _rs1_ into a floating-point number in
    floating-point register _fd_.

    All floating-point to integer and integer to floating-point conversion instructions round
    according to the _rm_ field.
    A floating-point register can be initialized to floating-point positive zero using
    `fcvt.s.w rd, x0`, which will never set any exception flags.

    All floating-point conversion instructions set the Inexact exception flag if the rounded
    result differs from the operand value and the Invalid exception flag is not set.
