  long_name: Single-precision floating-point equal
  description: |
      Writes 1 to _rd_ if _fs1_ and _fs2_ are equal, and 0 otherwise.

      If either operand is NaN, the result is 0 (not equal). If either operand is a signaling NaN, the invalid flag is set.

      Positive zero is considered equal to negative zero.
