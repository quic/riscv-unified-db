fclass.s:
  long_name: Single-precision floating-point classify.
  description: |
      The `fclass.s` instruction examines the value in floating-point register
      _fs1_ and writes to integer register _rd_ a 10-bit mask that indicates
      the class of the floating-point number.
      The format of the mask is described in the table below.
      The corresponding bit in _rd_ will be set if the property is true and
      clear otherwise.
      All other bits in _rd_ are cleared.
      Note that exactly one bit in rd will be set.
      `fclass.s` does not set the floating-point exception flags.
