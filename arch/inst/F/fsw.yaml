fsw:
  long_name: Single-precision floating-point store
  description: |
    The `fsw` instruction stores a single-precision floating-point value in _fs2_ to memory at address _rs1_ + _imm_.

    `fsw` does not modify the bits being transferred; in particular, the payloads of non-canonical NaNs are preserved.
