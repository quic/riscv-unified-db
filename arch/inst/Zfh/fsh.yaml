fsh:
  long_name: Half-precision floating-point store
  description: |
    The `fsh` instruction stores a half-precision floating-point value
    from register _rd_ to memory at address _rs1_ + _imm_.

    `fsh` does not modify the bits being transferred; in particular, the payloads of non-canonical NaNs are preserved.

    `fsh` ignores all but the lower 16 bits in _rs2_.

    `fsh` is only guaranteed to execute atomically if the effective address is naturally aligned.
