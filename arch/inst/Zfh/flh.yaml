flh:
  long_name: Half-precision floating-point load
  description: |
    The `flh` instruction loads a single-precision floating-point value from memory at address _rs1_ + _imm_ into floating-point register _rd_.

    `flh` does not modify the bits being transferred; in particular, the payloads of non-canonical NaNs are preserved.

    `flh` is only guaranteed to execute atomically if the effective address is naturally aligned.
