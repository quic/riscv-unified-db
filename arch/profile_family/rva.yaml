    The RVA profiles are intended to be used for 64-bit application
    processors running rich OS stacks.  Only user-mode and
    supervisor-mode profiles are specified in this family.

    NOTE: There is no machine-mode profile currently defined for
    application processor families.  A machine-mode profile for
    application processors would only be used in specifying platforms for
    portable machine-mode software. Given the relatively low volume of
    portable M-mode software in this domain, the wide variety of potential
    M-mode code, and the very specific needs of each type of M-mode
    software, we are not specifying individual M-mode ISA requirements in
    the A-family profiles.

    NOTE: Only XLEN=64 application processor profiles are currently
    defined.  It would be possible to also define very similar XLEN=32
    variants.
