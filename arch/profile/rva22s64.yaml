  - name: Sstc
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      Sstc was not made mandatory in RVA22S64 as it is a more
      disruptive change affecting system-level architecture, and will take
      longer for implementations to adopt.  It is expected to be made
      mandatory in the next profile release.
  - name: Sscofpmf
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      Platforms may choose to mandate the presence of Sscofpmf.
  - name: Zkr
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      Technically, Zk is also a privileged-mode option capturing that
      Zkr, Zkn, and Zkt are all implemented.  However, the Zk rollup is less
      descriptive than specifying the individual extensions explicitly.
