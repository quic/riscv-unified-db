    date: 2024-07-29
    changes:
    - First version after moving non-microcontroller content in this document to a new document
      called “RISC-V CRDs (Certification Requirement Documents)”
    - Change MC-1 Unpriv ISA spec from
      “https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/riscv-spec-v2.1.pdf[riscv-spec-v2.1], May 31,
      2016” to https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/tag/Ratified-IMAFDQC since the
      former isn't ratified by the latter is the oldest ratified version.
    - Added requirements for WFI instruction
    - Added requirements related to msip memory-mapped register
  - version: "0.6"
    date: 2024-07-11
    changes:
    - Supporting multiple MC versions to support customers wanting to certify existing microcontrollers not using the latest version of ratified standards.
    - Changed versioning scheme to use major.minor.patch instead of 3-digit major & minor.
    - Added a table showing the mapping from MC version to ISA manuals.
    - "..."

  overview: |
    This Certification Plan proposes requirements for the “MC” certified RISC-V microcontroller.
    MC targets microcontrollers running low-level software on an RTOS or bare-metal.
    The MC is not intended for the smallest possible microcontrollers but rather for applications
    requiring a certified microcontroller.
    See the https://docs.google.com/document/d/133SZKc18tLsQcT1o6gEmBUkjwrtg2ow63me54RQ1jiY[RISC-V Certification Plan]
    document for information relevant to all RISC-V Certification Plans.

    The MC (M = Microcontroller, C = Certified) has the following naming scheme (suffixes after MC
    are optional but in the below order):
